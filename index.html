          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <p>
            As an undergraduate first year student with a passion for frontend
            development and a solid foundation in programming languages, I bring
            a unique perspective and skillset to any team or project. My
            dedication to staying current with industry trends and best
            practices has allowed me to stay up-to-date with the latest
            advancements in frontend development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a strong understanding of programming languages such as HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and I am always eager to learn more. In
            addition, I have experience with various frontend frameworks such as
            React, Angular, and Vue, which has helped me to develop a
            well-rounded skillset.
          </p>
          <p>
            My ability to work well in a team environment and my strong
            communication skills have allowed me to collaborate effectively with
            others on projects. I am also highly organized and detail-oriented,
            which has helped me to ensure that projects are completed on time
            and to a high standard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I am confident that my passion for frontend development,
            programming skills, and strong work ethic would make me a valuable
            addition to any team.
